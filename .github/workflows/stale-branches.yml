# This Github Action will identify stale branches and mark them for deletion after a set period.
#
# By default, branches are identified as stale if their latest commit is older than 90 days. 
# This is useful for repositories that have many contributors that work on and off, and may forget to cleanup ðŸ§¹
#
# How it works?
# This Action look for branches whose last commit is older than a `days-before-branch-stale` days. 
# It will first add a comment on the latest commit, notifying the contributor that their branch is stale. 
# If no action is taken before `days-before-branch-delete` days, the branch will be removed.
#
# This can be prevented by removing the comment, or adding new commits to the branch.
#
# See https://github.com/marketplace/actions/remove-stale-branches for configuration options
